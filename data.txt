Poem
   Twas brillig, and the slithey tothes
   Did gyre and gymbol in the wabe.
   All mimsey were the borogroves
   And the momewraths outgrabe.
   Beware the Jabberwock, my son,
   The jaws that bite, the claws that catch.
   Beware the Jub Jub bird, and shun,
   The frumious bandersnatch.
   He took his vorpal sword in hand,
   Long time the manxome foe he sought.
   So rested he by the Tum Tum tree
   And stood a while in thought.
   And as in uffish thought he stood,
   The Jabberwock with eyes of flame
   Came flitting through the tulgey wood
   And burbled as it came.
   One two, one two, and through and through,
   His vorpal blade went snicker snack.
   He left it dead, and with its head
   He went calumphing back.
   And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
   Come to my arms, my beamish boy.
   Oh frabjous day! Calooh callay!
   He chortled in his joy.
   Twas brillig, and the slithey tothes
   Did gyre and gymbol in the wabe.
   All mimsey were the borogroves
   And the momewraths outgrabe.
