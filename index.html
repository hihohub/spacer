<h3 align='center'>copyright James Smith 2015</h3>
<p>To install a datatree on your web page, simply include a container element with the id DATATREE and an indented outline between the tags, here a poem by Lewis Caroll. The 'root' attribute designates the text for the root node, here 'a poem'. The 'toolbar' attribute adds buttons, here 'collapse,expand'. The 'treeheight' attribute restricts the height. We have also added a style attribute of width:50%;margin-left:25%. Finally, import Jdatatree10.0.js and add another script with one line in the onload handler, JDATATREE.AutoInit();</p>

<div id='DATATREE' style='width:60%;margin-left:20%;' root='A poem' toolbar='collapse,expand,edit,input' treeheight='200px' src='./data.txt'>
</div>

<p>Jdatatree was designed for large outlines that fill the width of the page. The expanded toolset for the toolbar includes a search box, an editing menu, load and save buttons, and numbering and alphabetizing tools. The outline may be loaded from a file or embedded between the container tags. The outline may take the form of indented text or an html list. Visit github.com/hihohub/jdatatree to learn more.</p>
